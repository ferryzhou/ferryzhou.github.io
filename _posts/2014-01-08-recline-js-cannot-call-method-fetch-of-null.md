i found backend.gdocs.js is removed from recline.js package and now it's in a new package called recline.backend.gdocs

download the js file <a href="https://raw.github.com/okfn/recline.backend.gdocs/master/backend.gdocs.js" target="_blank">here</a> and include it to your html file should solve the problem

so scaffolding on top of base model can increase intelligence a lot

and strong base model also leads to better performance

input are problem, sample data, scorer, base model, some code evolution algorithm and calls base model.

output is the code that can solve the puzzles

the stronger the model, the more efficient and more accurate the code evolve component

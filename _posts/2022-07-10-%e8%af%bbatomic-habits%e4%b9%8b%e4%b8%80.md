Carl Jung: &quot;Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate&quot;

&quot;The human brain is a prediction machine&quot;

or pattern recognition machine

&quot;with enough practice, you can pick up on the cues that predict certain outcomes without consciously thinking about it&quot;

it's like a &quot;machine learning&quot; or a &quot;deep learning&quot; system.

data -&gt; train -&gt; model -&gt; unconsciously predict

&quot;we underestimate how much our brains and bodies can do without thinking, you do not tell your hair to grow. your heart to bump. your lungs to breathe, or your stomach to digest. and yet your body handles all this and more on autopilot&quot;

our human body is like a machine. mostly run without consciousness. and run automatically, following rules/programs.

habits are part of the machine/program.

tried cursor to help me debug and fix an issue about ares sc2 placement crash issue with error message. cursor responded with some code, applied and almost everything is wrong, or hallucinated. many of the classes, functions do not exists. have to delete all and start my own debugging and fixing process.

i guess one reason is that the ares sc2 code is not widely used. so no much training data for llm.

the second reason is that llm didn't do fact check based on real python packages

it's not true understanding

my son have a python class yesterday and learnt to use copilot to generate code

he also tried generating a snake game, which is successful and he feels excited

however, it can easily lead to illusion that coding assistant can do all things

the reality is far from that.

as programmer, we still need to master the coding, know how to write code, looking for api, debugging, fixing etc.

on the other hand, llm suggested code completion is usually good. most are common patterns or names in the context, so accuracy is high

smile. there's some evidence that simply smiling can be as effective as antidepressant medications

// so from a different perspective, a depressed person seldom smiles.
// also, if a person smiles a lot, it means he/she is in a good mood.
// and if there's a place where people smile a lot, it's a good place.
// awana is such a place where kids smile a lot.

if you are around happy, upbeat people, it will tend to lift your mood.

attitudes, beliefs, behaviors, emotions - they are all contagious.

What's the difference between wish and expectations?

Wishes and expectations are related concepts, but they differ in important ways:

Wishes:
1. Desires or hopes, often without a strong basis in reality
2. May be unrealistic or even impossible
3. Not necessarily tied to probability or likelihood
4. Often emotional or aspirational in nature
5. No inherent disappointment if unfulfilled

Expectations:
1. Beliefs about what will or should happen
2. Usually based on past experiences, evidence, or promises
3. Generally more realistic and grounded
4. Often involve a sense of entitlement or prediction
5. Can lead to disappointment if not met

Key differences:
- Probability: Expectations typically have a higher perceived likelihood of occurring than wishes.
- Emotional investment: Unmet expectations often cause more disappointment than unfulfilled wishes.
- Basis: Expectations are usually formed from evidence or patterns, while wishes can be purely imaginative.
- Action: Expectations may influence behavior and planning, whereas wishes might not.

For example, you might wish to win the lottery (unlikely, emotional desire) but expect to receive your paycheck on time (realistic, based on past experience).

Would you like me to elaborate on any aspect of this comparison?

Does people get angry when their wish is net met?

People typically don't get as angry when a wish isn't met compared to when an expectation isn't fulfilled. However, emotional reactions can vary depending on the individual and the situation. Here's a more nuanced look:

1. Intensity of emotion:
- Wishes: Usually leads to mild disappointment or sadness if not met
- Expectations: Can cause stronger negative emotions, including anger, if not met

2. Reasons for less anger with unfulfilled wishes:
- Lower investment: People often invest less emotionally in wishes
- Understood unlikelihood: There's often an acknowledgment that wishes may not come true
- Less sense of entitlement: Wishes aren't typically seen as something owed or guaranteed

3. Exceptions where unfulfilled wishes might cause anger:
- If the wish was seen as easily achievable
- If someone promised to fulfill the wish but didn't follow through
- In cases of repeated disappointment over time
- For individuals with difficulty regulating emotions

4. Factors influencing reaction:
- Personal temperament
- Importance of the wish
- Cultural background
- Current life circumstances or stress levels

5. Children vs. adults:
- Children might react more strongly to unfulfilled wishes
- Adults generally distinguish better between wishes and realistic expectations

While anger isn't the typical response to an unfulfilled wish, it's important to note that emotional reactions can be complex and vary widely between individuals. The line between wishes and expectations can also blur, potentially leading to stronger reactions in some cases.

clean up usually requires lots of energy

it's a pain in short term because no incremental value created

and no obvious issue if not done

nothing break if not done

so no one is motivated to do that

it increase entropy of the system, could make next iteration harder due to increase cognitive load

however, still no one cares as people get promoted to setup but soon change teams

or the next team just ditch it and create something new

no one like clean up, unless there's reward for that

and if there's metrics, it will be better

something like save storage space, or save gcus / tpus

something tied to efficiency improvement, that has clear winning metrics

but many tasks has no efficiency gain, such as delete dead code, refactoring

only developer might feel the joy, but it takes time, and hard to quantify gain except lines of code contributed

g has some awards setup for eng excellence to encourage this type of work

is it possible to have a cleanup agent to automatically clean up?

like garbage collector in modern languages

like spam filtering in email

maybe we have to do it case by case

<a href="https://github.com/AresSC2/ares-sc2">https://github.com/AresSC2/ares-sc2</a>

noticed that for top open source bots, most of them are based on ares-sc2

the best one is <a href="https://github.com/vschmidt91/12PoolBot">https://github.com/vschmidt91/12PoolBot</a>, which can sometimes beat top bots

ares-sc2 seems greatly simplified bot programming

For Frits van Houts, who took over leadership of ASML's EUV business in 2013, the most crucial input into an EUV lithography system wasn't any individual component, but the company's own skill in supply chain management. ASML engineered this network of business relationships &quot;like a machine,&quot; van Houts explained, producing a finely tuned system of several thousand companies capable of meeting ASML's exacting requirements. ASML itself only produced 15 percent of an EUV tool's components, he estimated, buying the rest from other firms. This let it access the world's most finely engineered goods, but it also required constant surveillance.

old pc, win 10

only 1GB in C drive

checked my user directory, &gt;17GB

but after some cleanup, it's still 17GB

select all folders and click properties, &lt;1GB

so seems something hidden

googled &quot;windows show hidden files&quot;

file explorer -&gt; views, select hidden items

now found the root cause

there's a folder called &quot;AppData&quot;, which is ~16GB

and seems i cannot simply delete the whole folder

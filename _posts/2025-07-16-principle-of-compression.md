1. Fix it. Otherwise, the same issue can happen again and again.

2. Log it. 好记性不如烂笔头。written texts can be easily shared and spread. Voice is transient.

3. Automate it. Compress time and effort.

4. Standardize it. Common language, standard api, interface, specification, style.

5. Simplify it.

6. Generalize it.

7. Integrate it. Orchestrate multiple things and provide more powerful functionality.

&quot;Make sure there are no missing emails, and every email is in the right format&quot;

i have 50+ rows

it doesn't tell me which one is wrong

and turns out to be two emails that have a space in the end

very bad user experience. it should be able to handle the whitespaces. or at least identify which string is in the wrong format.

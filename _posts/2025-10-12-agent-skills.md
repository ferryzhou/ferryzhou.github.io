Very powerful

So basically llm cannot replace code

Code / program is still the foundation

The building blocks

They extend language

The power of agents is that it can translate natural language to tool calls and so text processing

So non programmers can do things with natural language

And could do complicated things with easy ask

Llm provided generic interface

But underlying implementation requires curated knowledge

Which is sample codes, instructions, references, prompts

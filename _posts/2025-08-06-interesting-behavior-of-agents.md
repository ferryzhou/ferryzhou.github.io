Seems it can handle the situation which is not explicitly mentioned in prompts/instructions.

This is something traditional code cannot handle. It might crash or simply fail when see something unexpected.

So basically I just say first find some files and delete them. I didnt mention what to do if no files found. The agent perfectly handled the corner case.

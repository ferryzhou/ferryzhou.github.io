Wondering what's the input to llm

The LLM is prompted to select one of three actions at each turn:get_current_board: Retrieve the current board state, often in a textual format like Forsyth-Edwards Notation (FEN) or a visual representation (e.g., ASCII board).

get_legal_moves: Obtain a list of legal moves in Universal Chess Interface (UCI) format (e.g., e2e4, a7a6).

make_move &lt;UCI move&gt;: Submit a move to be played (e.g., make_move e7e5).

And llm chess competition is not new:

So basically web or books do have many examples.

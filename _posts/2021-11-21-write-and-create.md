&quot;I never understand anything until I have written about it.&quot;

– Horace Walpole

&quot;What I cannot create, I do not understand&quot; – Feynman

&quot;Reading makes a full man, conversation a ready man, and writing an exact man.&quot;
-Bacon

“I write to know what I think.”

- Joan Didion
Considering all your tweets on writing, would it be wrong for me to expect a new essay on why writing is key for clear thinking.

“If you want to learn something, read about it. If you want to understand something, write about it. If you want to master something, teach it.”

― Yogi Bhajan

&quot;The writer is an explorer. Every step is an advance into a new land.&quot;

- Ralph Waldo Emerson

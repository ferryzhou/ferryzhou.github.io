in the era of LLM, or inspired by LLM

the art of prompt is the art of ask good questions

before LLM, ask good questions is also important

however, it limits to human world

when people trying to understand things, trying to solve problem, doing research

we already know asking good questions are critical

now this idea is materialized

we are forced to ask good questions

in this sense, we are forced to become better, to think more intelligently

it's not easy to ask good questions

it also requires training, requires deep understanding and wide knowledge base

similar to google, it does not make people become lazier or more stupid

instead, it reduces mental load of human and free them to do more intelligent/important things

today we don't have to remember many things, they are not searchable

memorize information is low intelligence

design / invent / get things done are more intelligent

LLM / GenAI is another level of intelligence assistant, in the sense that they can help on design / invent

so we will definitely become more powerful, more intelligent and more productive, with the help of these new AI tools

First, define complexity

Scope: work related

Out of scope: life, marriage, parenting

How to measure work complexity: avg time spent on work each week, including time spent at home, including time on work related reflection, brainstorming and planning.

First, measure existing time allocation:

1. meetings, 20~30 hours
2. emails, 10~20 hours
3. Doc/code reviews, 5~10 hours
4. Planning, okr, perf, check in write ups,2~4 hours
5. Designs, understanding, coding, querying, summarizing, presentation preparation, 4~8 hours.
6. Others.

So total 40~70 hours per week.

Roughly right. Work overtime is normal.

So what can be reduced?

The major chunks are meetings and emails.

For meetings, there are several categories:

1. 1on1s. Normally 6~10 hours.
2. Weekly project execution meetings, 6~12 hours
3. Design review meetings, 2~4 hours
4. Oncall, Eng excellence 1 hour
5. Others, 5~10 hours

llm already encoded world language, it can intelligently replace text, create code that has clear scope and context

so with a simple prompt, it can generate sophisticated code

this is the magic of genai.

this also means it enables high level natural language programming, with built in prior knowledge, text understanding, coding intelligence in llm.

it simplified interface

it's also more generic: everything through string. not bounded to specialized apis.

it breaks barriers of languages

when we write prompt

we can make it specific prompt

but we can further make it a more generic prompt

like we extract functions, common variables etc

it's equal to make new meta skills

and when there are enough skills for a task, it means enough knowledge and enough capability for a task

and all the skills can be shared

through natural language, through words

no api anymore

no more api lock-in.

there might be jargons

but still easy to translate

watched a replay of tie game

so lishimin bot keep building cannons in enemy's base

till the minerals exhausted

enemy still have second base

enemy exhausted minerals as well

both don't attack further so game tied

one simple improvement is to cap cannons build for each enemy's base, say 20

if cap reached, it should start rush the other bases

or even simpler, after initial rush, randomly build pylon and cannon on the map (or closer to enemy's starting location)

current stats

Wins	36	12.37%

Losses	155	53.26%

Ties	100	34.36%

If we can change ties to wins, then we can reach the win rate to 50%. or at least 30%, consider other bots might have silly strategies as well

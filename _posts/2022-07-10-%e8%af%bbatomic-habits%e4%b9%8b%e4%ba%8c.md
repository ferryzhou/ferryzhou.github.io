&quot;The two most common cues are time and location&quot;

For me, every weekend morning, I make breakfast for my family. On workdays, drive car to the office. once arrived in office, get a cup of water.

today we went to santa cruz beach. kids went to gift shop and bought something. so, the habit is, whenever we went to a new place, kids want to buy something.

&quot;creating an implementation intention is a strategy you can use to pair a new habit with a specific time and location&quot;

To speed up execution, we should have a detailed and easy to execute plan, with owners and ETA. and maybe an execution plan for the following one or two days.

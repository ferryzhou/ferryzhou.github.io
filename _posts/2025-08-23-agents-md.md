<a href="https://agents.md/">https://agents.md/</a>

A simple, open format for guiding coding agents, used by over 20k open-source projects.

Think of AGENTS.md as a README for agents: a dedicated, predictable place to provide the context and instructions to help AI coding agents work on your project.

So Claude code use claude.md, Gemini use gemini.md. different agent use different names. Now agents.md make consolidate it.

Simple idea, but powerful.

haven't program sc2 bots for a while

checked ai arena

<a href="https://aiarena.net/competitions/32/">2025 season 1</a> finished

my three bots:

qin2: 1479, division 3, rank 11

Han: 1409, division 3, rank 17

lishiminv2: 1334, division 4, rank 5

checked some open source ai bots, like

<a href="https://github.com/MichalOp/StarTrain/tree/main">https://github.com/MichalOp/StarTrain/tree/main</a>

<a href="https://github.com/histmeisah/Large-Language-Models-play-StarCraftII">https://github.com/histmeisah/Large-Language-Models-play-StarCraftII</a>

performance not very good, can only beat computer hard or medium level

worse than my hard coded bots, which can beat computer cheatinsane, the highest level

so in the short term, maybe still do hard coded ones, to see har far i can reach.

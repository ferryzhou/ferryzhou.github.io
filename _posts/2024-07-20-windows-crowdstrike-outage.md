likely the most impactful IT outage in history

Microsoft definitely has responsibility

and Microsoft will definitely share brand damage

Microsoft is the host system

And allow a third party software update crash it's system.

Globally, in the same time

Lessons

1. Reliability is critical. System should always on.

2. Test / evaluate before deployment

3. Gradual rollout

4. Always have backup solutions. Windows + Mac + Linux.

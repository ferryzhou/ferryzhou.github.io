title: "sc2 bots rule based vs ML based"

Currently, seems most bots are rule based

Did some only search, there's not many ML based bots or tutorials

Read some RL tutorials

But apparently performance not good

And it's hard to setup and train

Hard to get massive amount of training data

Hard to get lots of computing resources as well

And improvement not significant

Not like rule based, very easy to get something powerful.

Very easy to understand and make specific changes, easy to iterate

However, I still believe in ML.

Maybe there's some easy ways to speed up learning process and reduce data requirements.

It's tempting to build rule based bots and keep refining

But ML based is still more generic, and simple in terms of architecture.

For next step, will start try ML based bots.

don't know why i don't like the term agent

anyway, i think automation can reach another level due to llm

many of the tasks can be automated due to the power of llm, which can understand and parse unstructured data, human texts etc.

like customer support

and now companies are racing to develop solutions to automatically solve software bugs / issues

it requires more complicated and advanced techniques.

because even a programmer needs some level of understanding, technical details and debugging skills to fix issues.

a new paradigm emerged, basically, for anything, we should ask

can we solve this problem with llm + software?

can we automate this process?

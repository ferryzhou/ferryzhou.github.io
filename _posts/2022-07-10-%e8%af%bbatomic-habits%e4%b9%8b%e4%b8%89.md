&quot;motivation is overrated; environment often matters more&quot;

&quot;in 1936, psychologist Kurt Lewin wrote a simple equation that makes a powerful statement: Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment, or B = f(P,E). &quot;

&quot;many of the actions we take each day are shaped not by purposeful drive and choice but by the most obvious option&quot;

If they couldn't fall asleep, they were told to site in a different room until they became sleepy. over time, subjects began to became easier to quickly fall asleep when they climbed in bed. Their brains learned that sleeping - not browsing on their phones, not watching television, not staring at the clock - was the only action that happened in that room&quot;

&quot;create a separate space for work, study, exercise, entertainment, and cooking. The mantra I find useful is &quot;one space, one use&quot;&quot;

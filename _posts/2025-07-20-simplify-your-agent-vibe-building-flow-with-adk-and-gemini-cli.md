<a href="https://developers.googleblog.com/en/simplify-agent-building-adk-gemini-cli/">https://developers.googleblog.com/en/simplify-agent-building-adk-gemini-cli/</a>

so the key is <a href="https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/llms-full.txt">https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/llms-full.txt</a>

it's generated with a python code: <a href="https://github.com/google/adk-python/commit/a903c54bacfcb150dc315bec9c67bf7ce9551c07">https://github.com/google/adk-python/commit/a903c54bacfcb150dc315bec9c67bf7ce9551c07</a>

basically it compiles all readme, docs, and python api reference into a single txt file, which can be used as llm context.

what if just use repomix?

Code is read and run orders of magnitude more times than it's written. This, one person expending additional efforts once (when writting the code) results in hundreds of people expending less efforts multiple times (when using the code).

The same scaling phenomenon does not only apply to code, but to any easily replicated item, such as songs, cars, books and courses.

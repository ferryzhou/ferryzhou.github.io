被这个评论给吸引住了

记得以前听过这个故事，但是忘了

When I was learning photography, I heard a story about a photography teacher who divided his class into two groups: one group was graded on the quality of their best photos, and the other group was graded on how many photos the produced. At the end of the semester, the professor looked at which group produced the best work, and the pattern was clear: the majority of the highest quality photos came from the group asked to produce more work.

今年给手下做annual review

简单拿cl数量排了一下序

感觉跟自己的评价确实是正相关的

cl数量多的一般来说deliver也多

当然，到了四级以上也要看communication，x team collaboration 这些软技能。越往上越看这些

那么emails，design docs, presentations, reciews, analysis都可以算是productivity的一部分

纯粹看cl有一个问题是担心别人会game it

这个问题可以通过关注launches或者deliverable来解决。看design doc和review时的表现。是不是对自己领域的问题很清楚。解决方案靠谱不靠谱。

把一个事情simplify其实是要花更多精力的。无论是沟通的simplify还是代码的simplify，还是解决方案的simplify。

with google calendar time insights for 2025

1:1, ~300 hrs.

team meetings, ~360 hrs

deep work, ~400 hrs

according to google search, A standard full-time work year has 2,080 hours (40 hours/week x 52 weeks), but the actual number for most people is lower due to holidays, vacation, and sick days, usually falling between 1,700 and 1,900 hours.

so let's use 1800 as standard working hours per year

so 1/6 of my time is spent with 1:1 meetings, 1/5 on team meetings, another 1/5 for deep work.

there are many slots not marked. or just default, which is 600 hrs, so 1/3.

some not tracked, like empty slots, or non-working-hours.

the main insight is 18% 1:1 and 20% team meetings. if consider gaps between the meetings, then roughly 50% time in office is in meetings. not counting lunch and breakfast time.

this seems better than last year, but still too much. and i've already removed lots of meetings.

a few ideas for next year: reduce time or 1:1 meeting frequencies. hopefully reduce to 12%. delegate some meetings to others.

another thing is communication cost. like realtime pings, emails. maybe ~10% of my time is handling those. CL/doc reviews also take 10%~20% time.

so roughly 8 hrs / week deep work time is likely already a max. have to use non working hours to get more time for deep work.

to reduce questions&amp;answers pings, maybe improve documentation or develop some agent to help answer questions.

also need to consider agents to increase velocity.

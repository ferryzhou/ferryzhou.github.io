should be available before

the only download button download the original stl file

and the print button does not work because cannot add printer

spent about half an hour and found a solution

copy the link

open chrome

search creality and login

then paste the link

the gcode gz file will be downloaded.

maybe the best solution is to setup bluetooth for the ender-3 pro

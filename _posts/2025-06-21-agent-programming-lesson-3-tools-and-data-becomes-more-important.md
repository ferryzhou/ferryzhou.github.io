Llm is good at understanding text, human input, prompts, planning, but lack specialized knowledge and capacities that's not in training data.

And these can be achieved through tools and data access.

So for many applications that needs special or proprietary knowledge and do some operations, the agent needs to relies on integration with those tools and data.

Those tools likely be built with conventional paradigm, i.e. deterministic code logic and program.

Tools and data are hard things.

And because llm enables easy integration and collaboration of different tools and data. The demand for tools and data will significantly increase.

Of course, the tools could be built with agent.

So we will see more tools to be built. And more data to be collected and created.
